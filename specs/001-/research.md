# Research: “斗牛牛”棋牌游戏服务器

## Summary

No specific research tasks were required for this implementation plan.

## Rationale

The feature specification provided a clear and comprehensive technical stack and set of requirements, leaving no significant ambiguities that would necessitate a research phase.

- **Language and Framework**: Go and the Zinx framework were explicitly mandated.
- **Communication Protocol**: The use of TCP long connections with a `MsgID + Protobuf` data format was clearly defined.
- **Architecture**: A high-level architecture involving a `RoomManager`, `Room`, and `Player` objects was provided.

All technical decisions were pre-determined by the project requirements, so we are proceeding directly to the design phase.
